# londonfabricusergroup_data_challenge_UK_road_accidents

The London Fabric Usergroup holds data challenges where they supply us with a public dataset for us to carry out our own projects using Fabric ecosystem.
I took on this challenge to practice my DAX coding to create different chart types to analyse the UK road traffic accident dataset.

A link to the public view of this report is available [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYjc0YmM5ZDEtMzJhMS00NjgxLWE2YmMtNTJiN2E2MmRiNTBjIiwidCI6ImNlZjk5OTUzLWM0OTYtNGE4MS1iMDYxLTNlYmU1ODRjY2ZjYyIsImMiOjh9)

*Note that due to the report size, the Power BI report is shared as a .pbib file including the Dataset and Report folders required for you to open this report.*
*Before opening the pbib file make sure the folders are in the same location and upon opening the .pbib file a pop-up will show to refresh the data.*
